# Learning Reinforcement Learning: PPO on CartPole-v1

This project is a hands-on exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) concepts, aimed at understanding the basics of policy optimization using the CartPole-v1 environment as a case study.

## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to get a practical understanding of RL concepts like environment interaction, state-action-reward modeling, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) training.

### Key Features

- **Environment**: Gym's `CartPole-v1` used as a simple control task.
- **RL Algorithm**: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) implemented using Stable-Baselines3.
- **Visualization**: Real-time rendering of the CartPole environment.
- **Logging**: TensorBoard support to track learning progress.
- **Focus**: Simplified implementation for educational purposes.
